# GPT-2
## Recreating the GPT-2 Model (originally in TensorFlow) in PyTorch
This implementation of GPT-2 in PyTorch is based on the original paper ["Language Models are Unsupervised Multitask Learners"](https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf) by Radford et al. (2019). The model is a decoder-only transformer architecture, which is different from the original transformer implementation proposed in the "Attention Is All You Need" Paper in 2017..

## Optimizations and Technical Details

### Weight Sharing Scheme
The model uses a weight sharing scheme, where the input embedding matrix and the output matrix before the softmax layer are shared. This scheme reduces the number of parameters and makes training more efficient.

### Flash Attention
The model uses Flash Attention, a kernel fusion algorithm that is 7.6% faster than the traditional self-attention mechanism.

### Automated Mixed Precision (AMP)
The model uses AMP to reduce the precision of the tensor representation, which speeds up training and reduces memory usage.

### Fused AdamW Optimizer
The model uses a fused AdamW optimizer, which is a kernel fusion algorithm that combines the Adam optimizer with weight decay.

### Gradient Accumulation
The model uses gradient accumulation to update the gradients in batches, which reduces the memory usage and speeds up training.

### Learning Rate Scheduler
The model uses a learning rate scheduler that warms up the learning rate from 0 to a maximum value, and then decays it to a minimum value.

### Model Configuration
The model configuration is defined in the `ModelConf` dataclass, which includes the block size, vocabulary size, number of layers, number of heads, and embedding dimension.

### Device and Precision
The model is trained on a GPU device with a precision of `torch.bfloat16`, which reduces the memory usage and speeds up training.

## Results
The model is trained for 50 steps, and the loss and logits are printed at each step. The final loss and logits are also printed at the end of the training loop.

Note: This implementation is for educational purposes only and may not achieve the same performance as the original GPT-2 model.

## Future Work and Improvements
- Add detailed Evaluation Metrics.
- Train on a larger dataset with more compute.
